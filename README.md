# Chinese MNIST Dataset
This notebook has been created in Kaggle. It consists of CNN methods for Chinese Digit Recognition. It has a accuracy of 98.93% as of now, which I think is a pretty good accuracy. In order to run this Notebook, Copy & Paste the code in a kaggle notebook with the Dataset already been uploaded in the notebook.

Here are few Images of the Test Results:
This is the Image of the CNN Layers/Architeture that I have used for this dataset.

This shows how the loss gets decreased and accuracy improves with each cycle/epochs, I have ran this on 20 Epochs inorder to get the desired accuracy.
